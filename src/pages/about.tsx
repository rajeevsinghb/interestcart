        About InterestCart
      </h1>

      {/* Intro */}
      <p className="mb-4">
        InterestCart is built to help users understand banking and financial
        products without hidden rules, confusing fine print, or misleading rates.
        We believe financial decisions should be based on clarity, not confusion.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        Our platform focuses on accuracy, transparency, and simplicity so you
        can make informed decisions with confidence.

      {/* Problem Section */}
      <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">
        The Problem We Are Solving
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4">
        Banking and financial products are often presented in a way that makes
        comparison difficult. Interest rates change based on conditions, hidden
        penalties apply after small mistakes, and important details are buried
        behind symbols and lengthy terms.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8">
        As a result, users spend hours visiting multiple websites, speaking to
        agents, or relying on incomplete information — often still unsure if
        they are making the right choice.
      </p>

      {/* Why InterestCart */}
      <h2 className="mb-3 text-2xl font-semibold">

        from misleading information.

        what truly matters — clear explanations, realistic calculations, and
        options that actually fit your needs.
      </p>
